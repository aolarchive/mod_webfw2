updates and new features

* Many functions were broken up into their own files
  for ease of management.
* XFF ACL options implemented.
  ==== EBNF =====
  start      := directives
  directives := ((src_ip)+ | last | first), ws?
  src_ip     := ws?, "src_ip", ws, IP_ADDR
  last       := ws?, "last", ws, INT
  first      := ws?, "first", ws, INT
  ==== /EBNF ====

  Example:
  webfw2_rw_xff X-Test "src-ip 127.0.0.1 first 2 last 1"

  This tells mod_webfw2 that the header X-Test should 
  only be processed if the real source address is 
  127.0.0.1. Furthermore this will only pick out the
  first 2 IP's within this header, along with the last
  1 IP.

* IP Validation added.
* NOT string matches not work correctly.
* new action types "thrash", "thrash_profile" and "pass"
* the pass action allows a user to match on a rule, and 
  if matched go to the next rule.
* new filter argument "update-rule". This allows an
  administrator to, if matched, update another rule
  with the source IP in the request. (Replaces the 
  static config within httpd.conf)
* Administrator can now set where he wants webfw2 to sit
  within the apache processing lifecycle. 
  webfw2_hook_access (On|Off)
  webfw2_hook_translate (On|Off)
  webfw2_hook_post_read (On|Off)
* Fixed some while() logic bugs.
* IP addresses are now checked for validity.
* New apache note variable "webfw2_passed" which includes
  every rule the query successfully matched before 
  hitting a block or the end of the ruleset. 
* New apache env/note "webfw2_matched_ip" which will display
  the actual IP address that was matched.
