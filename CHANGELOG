- Added the ability for '#' comments within whitelists. 
- Added ability to change the default return codes for blocks


1.1r1
* hotfix with recv() errorchecking, merged from the 1.0r17-5 branch.

* Many functions were broken up into their own files
  for ease of management.

* XFF ACL options implemented.
  ==== EBNF =====
  start      := directives
  directives := ((src_ip)+ | last | first), ws?
  src_ip     := ws?, "src_ip", ws, IP_ADDR
  last       := ws?, "last", ws, INT
  first      := ws?, "first", ws, INT
  ==== /EBNF ====

  Example:
  webfw2_rw_xff X-Test "src-ip 127.0.0.1 first 2 last 1"

  This tells mod_webfw2 that the header X-Test should 
  only be processed if the real source address is 
  127.0.0.1. Furthermore this will only pick out the
  first 2 IP's within this header, along with the last
  1 IP.

* IP Validation added.

* NOT string matches no work correctly.

* "pass" action type defined (to allow for a rule to match and continue
  processing)

* the pass action allows a user to match on a rule, and 
  if matched go to the next rule.

* new filter argument "update-rule". This allows an
  administrator to, if matched, update another rule
  with the source IP in the request. (Replaces the 
  static config within httpd.conf)

* Administrator can now set where he wants webfw2 to sit
  within the apache processing lifecycle. 
  webfw2_hook_access (On|Off)
  webfw2_hook_translate (On|Off)
  webfw2_hook_post_read (On|Off)

* Fixed some while() logic bugs.

* New apache note variable "webfw2_passed" which includes
  every rule the query successfully matched before 
  hitting a block or the end of the ruleset. 

* New apache env/note "webfw2_matched_ip" which will display
  the actual IP address that was matched.
    * created thrasher.c and thrasher.h which are a set of functions
      that simplify thrasher commands.
    * webfw2 can now send thrasher v1 v2 and v3 type packets.
    * cleaned up all the thrasher related functionality, much cleaner now.
    * new public functions
      - thrasher_query()
      - thrasher_connect()
      - thrasher_is_connected()
      - thrasher_should_retry()
    * new private functions
      - thrasher_recv_boolean()
      - thrasher_recv_v3_pkt()
      - thrasher_create_v1_pkt()
      - thrasher_create_v2_pkt()
      - thrasher_create_v3_pkt()

* New filter actions for thrasher:
 Thrasher v1 packets are the normal packet types
  action = thrash-v1
  action = thrash-v1 profile

 Thrasher v2 packets only send the 4 byte source address (no meta-data)
  action = thrash-v2
  action = thrash-v2 profile

 Thrasher v3 packets prepend a 32bit identifier post protocol ID, pre 4 byte addr.
  action = thrash-v3
  action = thrash-v3 profile

* Extra thrasher socket error checking.

* Converted Makefile to SCONS SConstruct 

* Previously an administrator had to configure a flow for a rule
  even if all of the entries in the rule were logically AND joined.
    
  You can now define a rule without a flow where you expect all sets
  within the rule to be joined via an AND.


1.1r3
    * test_filter will not parse whitelist for validity.
    - two definitions of "i" were found in an inner and outer loop, resulting
      in odd stack references when used. This was fixed.


1.1r4
    * new default note set for matching __wf2-method__ which is a string
      representation of the request method.
    * removed some useless debugging output.
    * simplified some of the functionality within webfw2_traverse_filter 
      in order to make it much easier to read.
    * Removed useless functionality from patricia.c
    * Cleaned up so we have no more compiler warnings.
    * in order to rid myself of the complexity of maintaining 
      patricia trie code I have decided to replace it with a 
      table based approach. 
   
      When an address is inserted into a table it looks at the
      bitlen (/32, /24) and inserts the address into the proper
      bucket 
      Something like 
      addr = "192.168.0.0/24"
      hashed-addr = make_hash(addr)
      >>> hash[24][hashed-addr] = addr

      To search this table we iterate through each bitlen, 
      AND our source-address with the netmask of the bitlen,
      then look in that specific bucket for an entry.
